Log of general performance and tweaks made while developing:

- Determing how to define structure for our model:
    - Initially HillClimbSearch was used paired with a BIC scoring method, but data might be too sparse to define any concrete
    edges.
    - Switched to BDeu scoring method, and while edges were defined this time, we decided to manually define a simple structure

- Optimizing the best range to differentiate "bad reviews" from "good reviews"
    - Initially started with (Good Reviews)[1.0, 2.0, 3.0] - (Bad Reviews)[4.0, 5.0] = delta
    - Might have to tweak to find more standout results

- Defining initial keywords while combing through data
    - Current keywords count towards the relevance scores for attributes i.e. "cleanliness_mentioned", but we can always add more words.

- Ablation Study
    - Look into removing a latent variable i.e. food_mentioned and see how much predictions change
